# Token Presale

Welcome to the Token Presale repository! This project focuses on developing an ERC20 token with additional minting and burning functionalities, alongside a robust Presale contract for managing token presale activities.

## Project Overview

### Developed Two Smart Contracts:

- **ERC20 Token:** Features minting, transferring, and burning capabilities.
- **Presale Contract:** Allows the owner to manage the presale effectively.

### Built a User-Friendly DApp with Two Pages:

- **User Page:** Enables token purchases and provides access to token stats and tokenomics.
- **Owner Tools Page:** Empowers the presale owner to control the presale, set token rates, mint/burn tokens, withdraw raised ETH, and redeem tokens to their account.
